# save-prompt-value
Problem-Statement:
With non common sso application we prompt end user to input his application user name and password for a first time to login to application.
This project is developed to save prompt value in database in an earlier phase so that if a new user comes , he can able to login to non common sso without re-inputting his application user name and password.
